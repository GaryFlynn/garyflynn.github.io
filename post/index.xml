By default, a vRealize Automation 8.x session log you into the Services page, when you and your users are greeted with the Quickstart banner. The easiest way to remove this is to configure a vSphere Cloud Account, however for some environments, vSphere isn't an endpoint used. In this case, to remove the banner, a simple API call or change in the UI is required.
Huge shoutout to Mark Brookfield for revealing the UI option.</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2021 vRealize Announcements</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmworld-2021-vrealize-announcements/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmworld-2021-vrealize-announcements/</guid><description>
VMworld 2021 was still held online only this year, which meant there was no shortage of announcements and information available for anyone interested. With a few large announcements including the Project Ensemble Tech Preview and Skyline Advisor Pro, there is plenty to keep an eye on in this space. Below I've listed a few things for each of the vRealize Suite products which caught my attention. Leave a comment below on what you're looking forward to in this next release!</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.5+ - Increase Session Timeout</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-85-increase-session-timeout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 15:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-85-increase-session-timeout/</guid><description>
By default, a vRealize Automation 8.x session will timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity. For those looking to increase the session timeout value, this hasn't been possible before vRealize Automation 8.5. This all changes with the release of vRealize Automation 8.5, as documented in the release notes here.
To increase the session timeout from the default 30 minutes, a simple API call is all that is required. The below code can be run from either the appliance directly, or from your desktop PC using cURL.</description></item><item><title>Setup vRealize Automation using Terraform</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/setup-vrealize-automation-using-terraform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 15:00:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/setup-vrealize-automation-using-terraform/</guid><description>
VMware has created a HashiCorp Terraform provider which can be used to set up your vRealize Automation (vRA) infrastructure, along with requesting deployments and consuming XaaS resources. This post will cover the basics of setting up vRA using Terraform.
The first two posts in this series cover the basics of Infrastructure as Code with vRA and Terraform along with creating your first Terraform configuration to deploy a vSphere virtual machine. To get started, have a read of the documentation available for either vRA 8 or vRA 7.</description></item><item><title>Create Your First vSphere Terraform Configuration</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-your-first-vsphere-terraform-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 19:36:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-your-first-vsphere-terraform-configuration/</guid><description>
To get started with HashiCorp Terraform, you can download the simple executable file from HashiCorp here. To understand the basics of Infrastructure as Code and Terraform, have a read of the post available here.
Terraform configuration files are text files with a .tf file extension. To get started, create a new folder for this configuration, along with a file called vsphere.tf. The first part to creating a Terraform configuration file is to define the provider you will interact with.</description></item><item><title>vRA &amp; Terraform: A New Way to Deploy</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-and-terraform-a-new-way-to-deploy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:10:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-and-terraform-a-new-way-to-deploy/</guid><description>
On January 28th 2021, I presented at the Automation User Group about vRealize Automation and Terraform and how they work together to provide a new way to deploy your infrastructure. The recording of the session will be available here and the slides are available from here.

vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.2 added support for changing the IP address range used by the internal Kubernetes cluster, which is great news as many organisation already use the 10.244.0.0/21 address space. Unfortunately if your network already uses the ranges 10.244.0.0/22 or 10.244.4.0/22, you will likely encounter issues, such a provisioning timeouts.
To resolve this issue in vRA 8.2, run the below commands to view your current configuration, and to update to a new range.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.x - vRA Not Starting if K8s IP Range is Changed</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-vra-not-starting-if-k8s-ip-range-is-changed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 17:59:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-vra-not-starting-if-k8s-ip-range-is-changed/</guid><description>
vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.0 introduced a completely new architecture by running the vRA application itself on top of a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. Unfortunately this was released with a hardcoded IP address range used by the internal k8s cluster. If your corporate network happened to be using the same IP addresses that were selected by the k8s cluster, then you would likely see plenty of errors in vRA.
Thankfully, vRealize Automation 8.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.2 - Terraform Configurations</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-82-terraform-configurations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 14:40:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-82-terraform-configurations/</guid><description>
vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.2 added support for running your Terraform (TF) configurations directly from the vRA interface. Simply register your code repository endpoint, either GitLab or GitHub, and select which Terraform configuration to run. The vRA logic will even map the deployed resources to your vRA Cloud Accounts, Cloud Zones, and deployed resource objects. This functionality is fantastic to extend the capabilities beyond the supported resource types. You could use the TF configurations to deploy an F5 load balancer, an Azure and AWS VM, as well as creating your Grafana dashboards and registering your Datadog agents all from a single configuration.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Setup Amazon Web Services Cloud Account</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-setup-aws-cloud-account/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 13:19:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-setup-aws-cloud-account/</guid><description>
vRealize Automation 8.x can integrate with several cloud providers, and to do this for your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment, select Cloud Assembly &amp;gt; Infrastructure &amp;gt; Connections &amp;gt; Cloud Accounts and create each of the cloud integrations you require.

Part one of this blog covered the installation and configuration of vRSLCM which can be found here and this post will cover deploying your first application.
Create an Environment In vRSLCM, the concept of environments can mean two different things. It could mean Dev/Test/Prod where multiple applications are deployed in one environment or it could mean Dev vRA/Dev vROps/Test vRA/Test vROps where each environment and application combination has its own environment.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Setup GitHub Integration</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-setup-github-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 20:01:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-setup-github-integration/</guid><description>
vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.x provides native integration to GitHub.com to share and sync your Blueprints and Action Based Extensibility (ABX) scripts. This integration is provided as a way to edit your blueprints and ABX scripts as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) objects and for vRA to then consume the changes once they are updated and committed to your repository. This integration is not designed as a way to backup or export your content to GitHub.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator - Kerberos Configuration File</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 11:02:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file/</guid><description>
To configure Kerberos authentication with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO), the krb5.conf file must be set up for your specific environment and the domain you are connecting to.

Today is a significant day for VMware with the announcements coming out primarily around vSphere 7 and the implementation of Project Tanzu. The vSphere client will now natively support running containers and VMs within the same unified console, the vSphere Client. One very interesting new feature is the VMware Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) that will be introduced to simplify the management of firmware, drivers and ESXi bundles.

VMware has recently released vRealize Automation 8.0 and with this comes a complete redesign of the vRealize Automation product. Are you just starting out on your Cloud Management Platform (CMP) journey and not quite sure which version to deploy? Hopefully this blog will help you understand some of the key differences between vRA 7.x and vRA 8.x and some familiar features which are missing from vRA 8.x.
The first place to start is by reading this excellent blog post by Chip Zoller (daphnissov) on the VMware Community Forums.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Troubleshooting</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 16:42:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-troubleshooting/</guid><description>
With the introduction of vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.0, the traditional appliance VAMI page is gone. This is replaced with the vRA CLI and the kubernetes command line tools. This post will show some of the more common CLI commands you may need. To use all of the commands below, use SSH to connect to the appliance and log in with the root username and password.

Once vRealize Automation 7.x is deployed, you must manually start the vRealize Orchestrator Configurator service to access the Configuration interface.
To do this, log into the vRealize Automation appliance by SSH using PuTTY (or your preferred Secure Shell client).
Run this command to verify that the service is set to automatically start.

VMware has just announced the latest release of the vRealize Suite (2019) and with it comes vRealize Automation 8.0 (vRA), vRealize Log Insight 8.0 (vRLI), vRealize Operations Manager 8.0 (vROps) and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.0 (vRSLCM). Noticeably absent is vRealize Business for Cloud (vRBC), as this product has been deprecated and the functionality has been migrated to vROps.

vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) stores all symptoms and alerts in an internal database where they are called Alerts and Alarms. To understand how the internal alerts and alarms correlate to symptoms and alerts, have a read of the excellent explanation by James Gill of VirtualCloudIT (https://virtualcloudit.net/2017/06/08/270/).
Once you understand the terminology of alerts and alarms, how can we ensure that our environment doesn't breach the recommended values for each? Well thankfully, vROps collects these metrics automatically, so we can create a dashboard to display the information needed.</description></item><item><title>Export NSX DFW Rules using vRO</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/export-nsx-dfw-rules-using-vro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 13:23:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/export-nsx-dfw-rules-using-vro/</guid><description>
Many organisations are seeing the value of NSX-v in SDDC environments, however there is no easy way to export the NSX Distributed Firewall (DFW) rules from NSX to a CSV file. To export all rules in the environment, we need to extract each of the firewall rule IDs and get the details extracted for each rule. We will then export this information in a CSV file and optionally email it to the requestor.</description></item><item><title>vRA 7.x Reclamation Machine Usage Thresholds</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-7-x-reclamation-machine-usage-thresholds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:32:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-7-x-reclamation-machine-usage-thresholds/</guid><description>
In vRealize Automation 7.x, you can discover Deployments for reclamation in the Administration &amp;gt; Reclamation &amp;gt; Deployments (Tenant Administrator) view or the Administration &amp;gt; Reclamation &amp;gt; Tenant Machines (IaaS Administrator) view.

With the introduction of NSX-v 6.4.2, NSX will now log the firewall rule hit count for each firewall rule in the DFW. You can then check the UI or API for the hit count on each individual firewall rule. This capability is fantastic, however there is no way to extract the hit count for every rule in the environment either through the UI or API. Hopefully the API is updated in the future for this feature ;)</description></item><item><title>File Shares / SMB Not Working</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/file-shares-smb-not-working/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/file-shares-smb-not-working/</guid><description>

With vROps prior to 6.7, Memory metrics have caused confusion when comparing the memory metrics generated from vSphere to the metrics generated from the Ep Ops management agent installed on the guest OS. Currently, the metrics shown from the vSphere data collection are memory metrics as seen from the ESXi host layer / VMkernel. This value is at times largely different to the guest OS memory metrics, as explained below. I have a blog post here which explains the different memory metrics in vROps prior to 6.</description></item><item><title>vROps Memory Metrics - Prior to vROps 6.7+</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrops-memory-metrics-prior-to-vrops-6-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 09:43:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrops-memory-metrics-prior-to-vrops-6-7/</guid><description>
Memory metrics in vROps have caused many customers confusion and I hope this post will explain the different metrics available and why the values don't necessarily reflect what you might think. Let's start with a few definitions to help set the context.
Virtual Machine / Guest: The virtual operating system object where the guest OS such as Windows Server is installed.
Host: The physical blade/rack mount server where ESXi is installed.</description></item><item><title>Downgrade / Remove vRA License</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/downgrade-remove-vra-license/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 16:09:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/downgrade-remove-vra-license/</guid><description>
I recently had the requirement to remove an existing vRealize Suite Enterprise key from vRealize Automation 7.3.1 and replace it with a vRealize Suite Advanced key. When you try to replace the license key from the VAMI, you will receive an error stating that you cannot downgrade license keys &amp;quot;Unable to downgrade existing license edition&amp;quot;. To replace the license you must do the following. Note, this is 100% not supported by VMware so use it at your own risk and always do it first in a test environment, and always ensure you have backups.</description></item><item><title>vRA / vRO - Add an Azure connection</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-vro-add-an-azure-connection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:20:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-vro-add-an-azure-connection/</guid><description>
Integrating vRA / vRO and Azure is available out-of-the-box with vRA 7.2+ and has been well documented by others for how to set the integration up (vaficionado.com).
The integration is fairly straightforward however I faced two main issues, the first being proxy settings and the second being an issue with the vRO workflow &amp;quot;Add an Azure connection&amp;quot;.
Update Azure Plugin To resolve other vRO / Azure bugs, ensure you update the Azure plugin in vRO to the latest version from https://kb.</description></item><item><title>VMware - Handy Blog Posts</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmware-handy-blog-posts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 07:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmware-handy-blog-posts/</guid><description>

One of the least discussed products from VMware, vRealize Lifecycle Manager (vRLCM), really is a fantastic product! I have been deploying vRealize Automation (vRA) since it was first purchased from DynamicOps and the first release of vCloud Automation Center was released. The vRealize suite of products have always been difficult to install and this product takes the majority of hassle out of this. This blog will cover the deployment of vRealize Lifecycle Manager.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 3 - vCenter Install &amp; Configure</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-3-vcenter-install-configure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 10:41:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-3-vcenter-install-configure/</guid><description>
To setup the NUC and install ESXi, follow part one of this guide. To configure the basic vSAN configuration for deployments pre vCenter 6.7, follow part two of this guide.
vCenter Appliance Installation With the Intel NUCs set up (and a vSAN datastore created if running pre 6.7 vCenter), it is time to install the vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA). As you probably know, the Windows vCenter Server is deprecated, so the vCSA will be deployed.</description></item><item><title>Create Active Directory Forest via PowerShell</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-active-directory-forest-via-powershell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2018 13:17:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-active-directory-forest-via-powershell/</guid><description>
This blog covers creating a new Active Directory forest and adding a secondary domain controller to the domain via PowerShell.
Create Active Directory Forest To create a new Active Directory (AD) forest, the below PowerShell commands can be run to simplify the process. To start off, run the below command to install the appropriate Windows Feature.

This guide will cover the ESXi installation and configuration process. If installing ESXi onto a bare-metal server from a USB, follow my guide here on how to create a bootable USB installer. Once you have your installation media ready, either a USB installer or the downloaded ISO, insert / attach the media and power on your server. If you are doing this in a nested ESXi environment, attach the media via the VMware Remote Console.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 2 - vSAN Configuration</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-2-vsan-configuration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:36:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-2-vsan-configuration/</guid><description>
To setup the NUC and install ESXi, follow part one of this guide. The following is the process to bootstrap loading the vCenter Server Appliance onto a vSAN datastore. This process was replaced in vCenter 6.7 which provides this capability natively through the installer. If you are deploying vCenter 6.7+, skip through to part three.
vSAN Configuration To install vCenter you need the datastore in place, which for my environment is vSAN.</description></item><item><title>Create a Bootable USB ESXi Installer</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-a-bootable-usb-esxi-installer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 19:39:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/create-a-bootable-usb-esxi-installer/</guid><description>
To install ESXi onto a bare metal server without a CD/DVD drive or a KVM console, the simplest way is to create a bootable USB drive with the ESXi installer. To do this, we will use a tool called Rufus.
Download the latest portable release of Rufus Download the ESXi ISO image (.iso file type) ESXi 6.7 ESXi 6.5 Connect the USB device to your Computer Open Rufus Select the USB device Select the ESXi installer ISO Ensure 'MBR partition' &amp;amp; 'BIOS or EUFI' are selected Select Start Select Yes to replace menu.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 1 - Intel NUC</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-1-intel-nuc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 16:52:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/homelab-setup-part-1-intel-nuc/</guid><description>
I have recently decided to purchase a homelab for myself to assist with getting my certifications up to date and after much research and procrastinating I have gone with the setup below. Overall I have been very happy with the performance and compatibility of everything and I have tried to link to all of the useful blogs that helped me along the way.

Every Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) administrator has a handful of WQL Collection Queries that you hang onto. I figured I would share my most commonly used queries. Let me know in the comments if you have any others. The below are just examples and you should test if they are appropriate for your environment.

With access to vCenter or vRealize Automation comes great responsibility. Clients often require a quick and easy way to take a short term snapshot of a server so that they can quick and easily rollback application changes. VMware provides a robust snapshot function, however when things go well these snapshots are often left behind or forgotten about.
Run PowerCLI and run the below commands to get a list of all VMs with a Snapshot</description></item><item><title>Increase WinRM / PowerShell Limits</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/increase-winrm-powershell-limits/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 03:29:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/increase-winrm-powershell-limits/</guid><description>
For many organisations, PowerShell remoting is done through a scripthost server where maximum concurrent session limits and maximum connected user limits can be reached. As explained in this Microsoft blog, the following error might be encountered.
