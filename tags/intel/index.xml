To setup the NUC and install ESXi, follow part one of this guide. The following is the process to bootstrap loading the vCenter Server Appliance onto a vSAN datastore. This process was replaced in vCenter 6.7 which provides this capability natively through the installer. If you are deploying vCenter 6.7+, skip through to part three.

Pahuello - Jan 6, 2020
Hi. Garry! Thank you for so detailed post about your homelab. I've decided to build my own lab with 2x Intel NUC 8th gen (BOXNUC8i5BEH2) but still have some questions. If it's not difficult to you, ping me in my email or telegram/twitter (@PaHUEllo). I'll be really grateful!
#### [Gary]( "garyflynnis@gmail.com") - Jan 0, 2020 Hi Pahuello, I'm currently on leave but I will shout out when I'm back to see if I can help in any way.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 1 - Intel NUC</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-1-intel-nuc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 16:52:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-1-intel-nuc/</guid><description>
I have recently decided to purchase a homelab for myself to assist with getting my certifications up to date and after much research and procrastinating I have gone with the setup below. Overall I have been very happy with the performance and compatibility of everything and I have tried to link to all of the useful blogs that helped me along the way.
