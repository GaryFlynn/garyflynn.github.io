I am recently messing with a homelab. I have esxi 6.7 running and also created the vCSA appliance, however, I am to get to the appliance on the web but not the vsphere web client. I am going to delete all tonight and follow this guide. I rebooted my router, reset connection and more and was getting a DNS error. I will follow your guide and comment later.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 3 - vCenter Install &amp; Configure</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-3-vcenter-install-configure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 10:41:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-3-vcenter-install-configure/</guid><description>
To setup the NUC and install ESXi, follow part one of this guide. To configure the basic vSAN configuration for deployments pre vCenter 6.7, follow part two of this guide.
vCenter Appliance Installation With the Intel NUCs set up (and a vSAN datastore created if running pre 6.7 vCenter), it is time to install the vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA). As you probably know, the Windows vCenter Server is deprecated, so the vCSA will be deployed.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Setup Part 2 - vSAN Configuration</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-2-vsan-configuration-comments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:36:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/homelab-setup-part-2-vsan-configuration-comments/</guid><description>

To setup the NUC and install ESXi, follow part one of this guide. The following is the process to bootstrap loading the vCenter Server Appliance onto a vSAN datastore. This process was replaced in vCenter 6.7 which provides this capability natively through the installer. If you are deploying vCenter 6.7+, skip through to part three.
vSAN Configuration To install vCenter you need the datastore in place, which for my environment is vSAN.</description></item><item><title>Get memory allocated based on OS</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/get-memory-allocated-based-on-os/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2017 04:50:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/get-memory-allocated-based-on-os/</guid><description>
The following Power-CLI command will evaluate a specific cluster and return the ratio of memory utilisation between Windows and Red Hat Linux virtual machines.

With access to vCenter or vRealize Automation comes great responsibility. Clients often require a quick and easy way to take a short term snapshot of a server so that they can quick and easily rollback application changes. VMware provides a robust snapshot function, however when things go well these snapshots are often left behind or forgotten about.
Run PowerCLI and run the below commands to get a list of all VMs with a Snapshot</description></item></channel></rss>
