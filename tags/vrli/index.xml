In the previous post we deployed all of the vRealize Suite products and we are now ready to log into vRLI and configure it for use. vRLI 8.0 has some significant improvements including Unlimited Exports of data (increased from 20,000 events), Content Pack Updates and a new OS in the form of Photon OS. For more information check out the VMware blog post here which includes details of how the single upgrade file will also move the OS from SUSE to Photon!</description></item><item><title>vRealize Suite 2019 - Easy Installer</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-suite-2019-easy-installer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:58:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-suite-2019-easy-installer/</guid><description>
VMware has just announced the latest release of the vRealize Suite (2019) and with it comes vRealize Automation 8.0 (vRA), vRealize Log Insight 8.0 (vRLI), vRealize Operations Manager 8.0 (vROps) and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.0 (vRSLCM). Noticeably absent is vRealize Business for Cloud (vRBC), as this product has been deprecated and the functionality has been migrated to vROps.
Announcing General Availability of vRealize Suite 2019, vCloud Suite 2019, and vCloud Suite 2019 Platinum!</description></item></channel></rss>
