To configure Kerberos authentication with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO), the krb5.conf file must be set up for your specific environment and the domain you are connecting to. The location of the krb5.conf file is different for different versions and deployments of vRO, so the below list shows the locations of the krb5.conf file for vRO 7 vs vRO 8 and standalone deployments vs embedded with vRA deployments.
In vRO 7.x standalone, the krb5.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator 8.x - Accessing Control Center UI</title><link>https://example.com/post/vrealize-orchestrator-8x-accessing-control-center-ui/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 13:24:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/vrealize-orchestrator-8x-accessing-control-center-ui/</guid><description>
In both vRealize Automation and Orchestrator 8.x, the appliances have been rebuilt using a kubernetes architecture. For this reason, the location of the different Orchestrator user interfaces has changed.
Orchestrator Client UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/orchestration-ui
Orchestrator Client Java UI - deprecated from vRO 8.0 onwards
Orchestrator Control Center UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/vco-controlcenter
To login to the Orchestrator Control Center UI, the username is 'root' and the password is the same as the appliance 'root' password.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Suite Announcement - March 2020</title><link>https://example.com/post/vrealize-suite-announcement-march-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 13:52:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/vrealize-suite-announcement-march-2020/</guid><description>
Today is a significant day for VMware with the announcements coming out primarily around vSphere 7 and the implementation of Project Tanzu. The vSphere client will now natively support running containers and VMs within the same unified console, the vSphere Client. One very interesting new feature is the VMware Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) that will be introduced to simplify the management of firmware, drivers and ESXi bundles. For more information on today's announcements, check out the blog here.</description></item><item><title>Start the vRealize Orchestrator Configurator Service</title><link>https://example.com/post/start-the-vrealize-orchestrator-configurator-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2019 15:25:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/start-the-vrealize-orchestrator-configurator-service/</guid><description>
Once vRealize Automation 7.x is deployed, you must manually start the vRealize Orchestrator Configurator service to access the Configuration interface.
To do this, log into the vRealize Automation appliance by SSH using PuTTY (or your preferred Secure Shell client).
Run this command to verify that the service is set to automatically start.
1chkconfig vco-configurator If the service reports &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;, run this command to enable an automatic restart of the vRealize Orchestrator Configurator service when the vRealize Automation appliance is rebooted in future.</description></item><item><title>Export NSX DFW Rules using vRO</title><link>https://example.com/post/export-nsx-dfw-rules-using-vro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 13:23:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/export-nsx-dfw-rules-using-vro/</guid><description>
Many organisations are seeing the value of NSX-v in SDDC environments, however there is no easy way to export the NSX Distributed Firewall (DFW) rules from NSX to a CSV file. To export all rules in the environment, we need to extract each of the firewall rule IDs and get the details extracted for each rule. We will then export this information in a CSV file and optionally email it to the requestor.</description></item><item><title>Extracting NSX DFW Rule Hit Counts</title><link>https://example.com/post/extracting-nsx-dfw-rule-hit-counts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 14:43:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/extracting-nsx-dfw-rule-hit-counts/</guid><description>
With the introduction of NSX-v 6.4.2, NSX will now log the firewall rule hit count for each firewall rule in the DFW. You can then check the UI or API for the hit count on each individual firewall rule. This capability is fantastic, however there is no way to extract the hit count for every rule in the environment either through the UI or API. Hopefully the API is updated in the future for this feature ;)</description></item><item><title>vRA / vRO - Add an Azure connection</title><link>https://example.com/post/vra-vro-add-an-azure-connection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:20:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/vra-vro-add-an-azure-connection/</guid><description>
Integrating vRA / vRO and Azure is available out-of-the-box with vRA 7.2+ and has been well documented by others for how to set the integration up (vaficionado.com).
The integration is fairly straightforward however I faced two main issues, the first being proxy settings and the second being an issue with the vRO workflow &amp;quot;Add an Azure connection&amp;quot;.
Update Azure Plugin To resolve other vRO / Azure bugs, ensure you update the Azure plugin in vRO to the latest version from https://kb.</description></item></channel></rss>
