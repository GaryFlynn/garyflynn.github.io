            &lt;p&gt;Part one of this blog covered the installation and configuration of vRSLCM which can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-part-1-install-configure/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and this post will cover deploying your first application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-an-environment&#34;&gt;Create an Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vRSLCM, the concept of environments can mean two different things. It could mean Dev/Test/Prod where multiple applications are deployed in one environment or it could mean Dev vRA/Dev vROps/Test vRA/Test vROps where each environment and application combination has its own environment. In my homelab, I have gone with the latter understanding as there are some limitations placing all of the products in a single environment instance. In the Create Environment wizard, enter the information for which you wish to deploy. Select Next when this is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-suite-lifecycle-manager-8-0-configuration/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; we went over the vRSLCM configuration and now we are ready to deploy the vRealize Suite of products. Before we start, I can not stress this enough... Read the release notes!! There are countless changes to each of the products and vRA 8.0 especially is missing some features which may return in vRA 8.1 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager/2019/rn/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager-80-Release-Notes.html&#34;&gt;vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.0 - Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/8.0/rn/vRealize-Automation-80-release-notes.html&#34;&gt;vRealize Automation 8.0 - Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Log-Insight/8.0/rn/vRealize-Log-Insight-80.html&#34;&gt;vRealize Log Insight 8.0 - Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/8.0/rn/vRealize-Operations-Manager-80.html&#34;&gt;vRealize Operations Manager 8.0 - Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Orchestrator/8.0/rn/VMware-vRealize-Orchestrator-80-Release-Notes.html&#34;&gt;vRealize Orchestrator 8.0 - Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vrealize-suite-2019-deployment&#34;&gt;vRealize Suite 2019 Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this environment is just your homelab, you can leverage the default datacenter otherwise it is best to create a new datacenter. To create a Datacenter, log into vRSLCM and select Lifecycle Operations &amp;gt; Datacenters on the left, then Add Datacenter. Enter a name along with the location and click Save. Add a vCenter Server to your new datacenter and Save. You should now see two datacenters. One called &amp;quot;default_datacenter&amp;quot; located in Palo Alto, California, US which contains the vIDM installation, and another new one for your new deployment. In vRSLCM 8.0.1 you can now edit the location of the default datacenter to match your actual location.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-suite-2019-easy-installer/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; we went over the vRSLCM Easy Installer which deployed vRSLCM 8.0 and vIDM 8.0. The installations went smoothly with no reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s log into the vRSLCM UI by navigating to https://&amp;lt;vRSLCM FQDN or IP&amp;gt;/ and log in with the username &amp;quot;admin@local&amp;quot; and the password you set in the deployment in the previous steps. Note the default username has changed from previous versions and is no longer admin@localhost. Don&#39;t get caught out trying to log in with the wrong username!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One of the least discussed products from VMware, vRealize Lifecycle Manager (vRLCM), really is a fantastic product! I have been deploying vRealize Automation (vRA) since it was first purchased from DynamicOps and the first release of vCloud Automation Center was released. The vRealize suite of products have always been difficult to install and this product takes the majority of hassle out of this. This blog will cover the deployment of vRealize Lifecycle Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
