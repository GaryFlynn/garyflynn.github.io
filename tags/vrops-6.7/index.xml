Hey Gaz! I first got confused by the amount of RAM that was given to a machine as it looked like the RAM was always fully used -- but actually it was just the way of displaying that the OS only reserved but factually never used it. Looking at the Utilization instead showed what was really going on. Very helpful, thank you very much.</description></item><item><title>vROps Memory Metric Collection Changes in 6.7 &amp; 7.0+</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrops-memory-metric-collection-changes-in-6-7-7-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 09:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrops-memory-metric-collection-changes-in-6-7-7-0/</guid><description>
With vROps prior to 6.7, Memory metrics have caused confusion when comparing the memory metrics generated from vSphere to the metrics generated from the Ep Ops management agent installed on the guest OS. Currently, the metrics shown from the vSphere data collection are memory metrics as seen from the ESXi host layer / VMkernel. This value is at times largely different to the guest OS memory metrics, as explained below. I have a blog post here which explains the different memory metrics in vROps prior to 6.</description></item></channel></rss>
