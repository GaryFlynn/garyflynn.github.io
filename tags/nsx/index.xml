            Many organisations are seeing the value of NSX-v in SDDC environments, however there is no easy way to export the NSX Distributed Firewall (DFW) rules from NSX to a CSV file. To export all rules in the environment, we need to extract each of the firewall rule IDs and get the details extracted for each rule. We will then export this information in a CSV file and optionally email it to the requestor.

      <title>Extracting NSX DFW Rule Hit Counts</title>

            With the introduction of NSX-v 6.4.2, NSX will now log the firewall rule hit count for each firewall rule in the DFW. You can then check the UI or API for the hit count on each individual firewall rule. This capability is fantastic, however there is no way to extract the hit count for every rule in the environment either through the UI or API. Hopefully the API is updated in the future for this feature ;)
