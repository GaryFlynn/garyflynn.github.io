      <title>vRealize Automation 8.x – Change Internal Kubernetes IP Range</title>

            &lt;p&gt;vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.2 added support for changing the IP address range used by the internal Kubernetes cluster, which is great news as many organisation already use the 10.244.0.0/21 address space. Unfortunately if your network already uses the ranges 10.244.0.0/22 or 10.244.4.0/22, you will likely encounter issues, such a provisioning timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this issue in vRA 8.2, run the below commands to view your current configuration, and to update to a new range.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.5&#43; - Increase Session Timeout</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-85-increase-session-timeout/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;By default, a vRealize Automation 8.x session will timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity. For those looking to increase the session timeout value, this hasn&#39;t been possible before vRealize Automation 8.5. This all changes with the release of vRealize Automation 8.5, as documented in the release notes &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Automation/8.5/rn/vmware-vrealize-automation-85-release-notes.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase the session timeout from the default 30 minutes, a simple API call is all that is required. The below code can be run from either the appliance directly, or from your desktop PC using cURL. Another option would be to run the same API calls in Postman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Hide Quickstart UI</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-hide-quickstart-ui/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;By default, a vRealize Automation 8.x session log you into the Services page, when you and your users are greeted with the Quickstart banner. The easiest way to remove this is to configure a vSphere Cloud Account, however for some environments, vSphere isn&#39;t an endpoint used. In this case, to remove the banner, a simple API call is all that is required. The below code can be run from either the appliance directly, or from your desktop PC using cURL. Another option would be to run the same API calls in Postman.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;VMware Explore EU 2022 was personally my first ever large conference and what an event it was! The biggest benefit of attending for me was to finally meet so many people who are also part of the broader vCommunity, along with fellow vExperts and colleagues from vendors who I have been working very closely with over the past 2-3 years. To everyone I managed to say hello to, thank you for helping to make this a truly amazing event!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;VMware Explore 2022 was set to be a big event for VMware, with the infamous VMworld branding being changed to VMware Explore along with this being the first in person event since 2019, due to COVID-19. Sure enough, there was no shortage of announcements and information available for everyone this year. Last year at VMworld 2021 we had the announcement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2021/10/introducing-project-ensemble.html&#34;&gt;Project Ensemble Tech Preview&lt;/a&gt; and this year we saw this formalise into VMware Aria Hub. In fact, the biggest announcement to come out of the event is the announcement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2022/08/introducing-vmware-aria.html&#34;&gt;VMware Aria&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;VMworld 2021 was still held online only this year, which meant there was no shortage of announcements and information available for anyone interested. With a few large announcements including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2021/10/introducing-project-ensemble.html&#34;&gt;Project Ensemble Tech Preview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/kb/2021/09/skyline-announcement.html&#34;&gt;Skyline Advisor Pro&lt;/a&gt;, there is plenty to keep an eye on in this space. Below I&#39;ve listed a few things for each of the vRealize Suite products which caught my attention. Leave a comment below on what you&#39;re looking forward to in this next release!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.x - vRA Not Starting if K8s IP Range is Changed</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-vra-not-starting-if-k8s-ip-range-is-changed/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.0 introduced a completely new architecture by running the vRA application itself on top of a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. Unfortunately this was released with a hardcoded IP address range used by the internal k8s cluster. If your corporate network happened to be using the same IP addresses that were selected by the k8s cluster, then you would likely see plenty of errors in vRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, vRealize Automation 8.2 added support for changing the internal IP address range used by the Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, there is a bug in the code where only the 10.0.0.0/8 and 127.0.0.0/8 address spaces are supported. If you choose to use the 192.168.0.0/16 address space, the vRA deployment won&#39;t start-up. When running the command &amp;quot;kubectl get pods -n prelude&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;catalog-service-app&amp;quot; pod will show as 0/1 Ready, and Running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.2 - Terraform Configurations</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-82-terraform-configurations/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.2 added support for running your Terraform (TF) configurations directly from the vRA interface. Simply register your code repository endpoint, either GitLab or GitHub, and select which Terraform configuration to run. The vRA logic will even map the deployed resources to your vRA Cloud Accounts, Cloud Zones, and deployed resource objects. This functionality is fantastic to extend the capabilities beyond the supported resource types. You could use the TF configurations to deploy an F5 load balancer, an Azure and AWS VM, as well as creating your Grafana dashboards and registering your Datadog agents all from a single configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;vRealize Automation 8.x can integrate with several cloud providers, and to do this for your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment, select Cloud Assembly &amp;gt; Infrastructure &amp;gt; Connections &amp;gt; Cloud Accounts and create each of the cloud integrations you require. For AWS, we simply need to head over to the AWS Console &lt;a href=&#34;https://console.aws.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;console.aws.amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and authenticate with the account which has access to the AWS account you want to integrate with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To integrate vRA 8.x with AWS, there are 2 configuration IDs and some permissions that need to be set up which we need to complete and provide to the vRA portal. These are covered in the sections listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Lifecycle Manager Part 2 - Deploying an Application</title>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;Part one of this blog covered the installation and configuration of vRSLCM which can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-part-1-install-configure/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and this post will cover deploying your first application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-an-environment&#34;&gt;Create an Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vRSLCM, the concept of environments can mean two different things. It could mean Dev/Test/Prod where multiple applications are deployed in one environment or it could mean Dev vRA/Dev vROps/Test vRA/Test vROps where each environment and application combination has its own environment. In my homelab, I have gone with the latter understanding as there are some limitations placing all of the products in a single environment instance. In the Create Environment wizard, enter the information for which you wish to deploy. Select Next when this is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.x provides native integration to GitHub.com to share and sync your Blueprints and Action Based Extensibility (ABX) scripts. This integration is provided as a way to edit your blueprints and ABX scripts as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) objects and for vRA to then consume the changes once they are updated and committed to your repository. This integration is not designed as a way to backup or export your content to GitHub. Integration in vRA 8.0 / vRA 8.0.1 is only available to GitHub.com and not GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Self-Hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Orchestrator - Kerberos Configuration File</title>

      <description>
        
          
            &lt;p&gt;To configure Kerberos authentication with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO), the krb5.conf file must be set up for your specific environment and the domain you are connecting to. The location of the krb5.conf file is different for different versions and deployments of vRO, so the below list shows the locations of the krb5.conf file for vRO 7 vs vRO 8 and standalone deployments vs embedded with vRA deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vRO 7.x standalone, the krb5.conf file is located in /usr/java/jre-vmware/lib/security/krb5.conf&lt;br&gt;
In vRO 8.x standalone, the krb5.conf file is located in /data/vco/usr/lib/vco/app-server/conf/krb5.conf&lt;/p&gt;

For vSphere, enter the vCenter FQDN / IP address, the credentials to authenticate with and select a logical name. Under capabilities, enter &amp;quot;cloud:vsphere&amp;quot; as this will enable us to use tagging in the blueprint request forms. Validate the credentials and once they are validated, select which datacenters to allow provisioning to, followed by selecting Add.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Today is a significant day for VMware with the announcements coming out primarily around vSphere 7 and the implementation of Project Tanzu. The vSphere client will now natively support running containers and VMs within the same unified console, the vSphere Client. One very interesting new feature is the VMware Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) that will be introduced to simplify the management of firmware, drivers and ESXi bundles. For more information on today&#39;s announcements, check out the blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/03/vsphere-7.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But what about the vRealize Suite announcements? That&#39;s what we are really interested in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRA 7.x vs vRA 8.x - Which Version to Deploy?</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/which-version-of-vra-to-deploy/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;VMware has recently released vRealize Automation 8.0 and with this comes a complete redesign of the vRealize Automation product. Are you just starting out on your Cloud Management Platform (CMP) journey and not quite sure which version to deploy? Hopefully this blog will help you understand some of the key differences between vRA 7.x and vRA 8.x and some familiar features which are missing from vRA 8.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first place to start is by reading this excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://communities.vmware.com/people/daphnissov/blog/2019/10/18/vrealize-automation-vra-8-faq&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Chip Zoller (daphnissov) on the VMware Community Forums. This vRA 8 FAQ provides plenty of answers to some of the obvious questions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.0, the traditional appliance VAMI page is gone. This is replaced with the vRA CLI and the kubernetes command line tools.

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Services</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-services/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;In the previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/post/vrealize-automation-8x-getting-started/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; we configured vRA 8.0 with a vSphere endpoint and in this post we are going to cover the different Services which are available. vRA 8.0 has four main components or services, Cloud Assembly, Service Broker, Code Stream and Orchestrator. Great, but what is the role of each service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
      decoding=&#34;async&#34;
      alt=&#34;&#34;
      
        class=&#34;image_figure image_internal image_unprocessed&#34;
        src=&#34;https://garyflynn.com/images/vra8-services.png&#34;
      
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-assembly&#34;&gt;Cloud Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Assembly service is the multi-cloud provisioning service and is where the bulk of your time will be spent. The Cloud Assembly service is where you can create your SDDC private cloud and it is also an abstraction layer across multiple clouds. This abstraction allows you to create blueprints which can be used to deploy applications across different cloud providers, mapping the cloud constructs of one public cloud provider with another. All of the usual features are there including viewing your existing deployments, creating blueprints and configuring Infrastructure. The addition of the &amp;quot;Guided Setup&amp;quot; on the right hand side helps with understanding how all of the terminology fits everything together. The Infrastructure tab in Cloud Assembly is where most of the configuration is done. Here you can create the different projects, cloud zones, flavour and image mappings and network and storage profiles. The infrastructure tab is also where the cloud accounts are defined and the compute, network, security, storage etc are all deployed, along with the Kubernetes integration. The table below maps the vRA 7.x constructs to the vRA 8.x constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRealize Automation 8.x - Getting Started (Quickstart)</title>

Let&#39;s get vRA 8.0 configured! Load up the vRA homepage https://&amp;lt;vRA FDQN&amp;gt;/ where you are greeted with the welcome page. One thing to note is that the new vRA 8.0 appliance does not contain a VAMI, instead non-UI configuration is done using the &amp;quot;vracli&amp;quot; commands on the appliance shell.&lt;/p&gt;

For more information check out the VMware blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2019/10/whats-new-in-vrealize-log-insight-8-0.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which includes details of how the single upgrade file will also move the OS from SUSE to Photon! Very impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Downgrade / Remove vRA License</title>

            &lt;p&gt;I recently had the requirement to remove an existing vRealize Suite Enterprise key from vRealize Automation 7.3.1 and replace it with a vRealize Suite Advanced key. When you try to replace the license key from the VAMI, you will receive an error stating that you cannot downgrade license keys &amp;quot;Unable to downgrade existing license edition&amp;quot;. To replace the license you must do the following. Note, this is 100% &lt;strong&gt;not supported&lt;/strong&gt; by VMware so use it at your own risk and always do it first in a test environment, and always ensure you have backups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>vRA / vRO - Add an Azure connection</title>
      <link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vra-vro-add-an-azure-connection/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;Integrating vRA / vRO and Azure is available out-of-the-box with vRA 7.2+ and has been well documented by others for how to set the integration up (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vaficionado.com/2016/11/using-new-microsoft-azure-endpoint-vrealize-automation-7-2/&#34;&gt;vaficionado.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration is fairly straightforward however I faced two main issues, the first being proxy settings and the second being an issue with the vRO workflow &amp;quot;Add an Azure connection&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-azure-plugin&#34;&gt;Update Azure Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve other vRO / Azure bugs, ensure you update the Azure plugin in vRO to the latest version from &lt;a href=&#34;https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55826&#34;&gt;https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55826&lt;/a&gt; (see attachment in the KB article). As the KB states, the updated plugin can be installed in vRA/vRO 7.2, 7.3, 7.3.1 &amp;amp; 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One of the least discussed products from VMware, vRealize Lifecycle Manager (vRLCM), really is a fantastic product! I have been deploying vRealize Automation (vRA) since it was first purchased from DynamicOps and the first release of vCloud Automation Center was released. The vRealize suite of products have always been difficult to install and this product takes the majority of hassle out of this. This blog will cover the deployment of vRealize Lifecycle Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
