vRealize Automation (vRA) 8.x provides native integration to GitHub.com to share and sync your Blueprints and Action Based Extensibility (ABX) scripts. This integration is provided as a way to edit your blueprints and ABX scripts as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) objects and for vRA to then consume the changes once they are updated and committed to your repository. This integration is not designed as a way to backup or export your content to GitHub.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator - Kerberos Configuration File</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file-comments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 11:02:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file-comments/</guid><description>

I think you may have a type-o for [domain_realm] Also please reference the VMware documentation for this * Configure Kerberos Authentication https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Orchestrator/8.2/com.vmware.vrealize.orchestrator-use-plugins.doc/GUID-1A829CCF-A147-422E-80B3-0819F8D6E6AE.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcINYCcBGBWAdAYwPYDsBmIAvkA
#### [Gary]( "garyflynnis@gmail.com") - Dec 5, 2020 Hi Scott, Thanks for spotting the typo. All fixed now. I have also added a link to the document you mentioned. It looks like this documentation was only published in September of this year. Cheers, Gary</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator - Kerberos Configuration File</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 11:02:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-kerberos-configuration-file/</guid><description>
To configure Kerberos authentication with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO), the krb5.conf file must be set up for your specific environment and the domain you are connecting to. The location of the krb5.conf file is different for different versions and deployments of vRO, so the below list shows the locations of the krb5.conf file for vRO 7 vs vRO 8 and standalone deployments vs embedded with vRA deployments.
In vRO 7.x standalone, the krb5.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator 8.x - Accessing Control Center UI</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-8x-accessing-control-center-ui/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 13:24:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/vrealize-orchestrator-8x-accessing-control-center-ui/</guid><description>
In both vRealize Automation and Orchestrator 8.x, the appliances have been rebuilt using a kubernetes architecture. For this reason, the location of the different Orchestrator user interfaces has changed.
Orchestrator Client UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/orchestration-ui
Orchestrator Client Java UI - deprecated from vRO 8.0 onwards
Orchestrator Control Center UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/vco-controlcenter
To login to the Orchestrator Control Center UI, the username is 'root' and the password is the same as the appliance 'root' password.</description></item><item><title>vRA 7.x vs vRA 8.x - Which Version to Deploy?</title><link>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/which-version-of-vra-to-deploy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 16:43:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.github.io/post/which-version-of-vra-to-deploy/</guid><description>
VMware has recently released vRealize Automation 8.0 and with this comes a complete redesign of the vRealize Automation product. Are you just starting out on your Cloud Management Platform (CMP) journey and not quite sure which version to deploy? Hopefully this blog will help you understand some of the key differences between vRA 7.x and vRA 8.x and some familiar features which are missing from vRA 8.x.
The first place to start is by reading this excellent blog post by Chip Zoller (daphnissov) on the VMware Community Forums.</description></item></channel></rss>
