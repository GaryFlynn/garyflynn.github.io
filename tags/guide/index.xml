This integration is provided as a way to edit your blueprints and ABX scripts as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) objects and for vRA to then consume the changes once they are updated and committed to your repository.

In both vRealize Automation and Orchestrator 8.x, the appliances have been rebuilt using a kubernetes architecture. For this reason, the location of the different Orchestrator user interfaces has changed.
Orchestrator Client UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/orchestration-ui
Orchestrator Client Java UI - deprecated from vRO 8.0 onwards
Orchestrator Control Center UI - https://FQDN_or_IP_address:443/vco-controlcenter

VMware has recently released vRealize Automation 8.0 and with this comes a complete redesign of the vRealize Automation product.

Hopefully this blog will help you understand some of the key differences between vRA 7.x and vRA 8.x and some familiar features which are missing from vRA 8.x.
