            &lt;p&gt;VMworld 2021 was still held online only this year, which meant there was no shortage of announcements and information available for anyone interested. With a few large announcements including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2021/10/introducing-project-ensemble.html&#34;&gt;Project Ensemble Tech Preview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/kb/2021/09/skyline-announcement.html&#34;&gt;Skyline Advisor Pro&lt;/a&gt;, there is plenty to keep an eye on in this space. Below I&#39;ve listed a few things for each of the vRealize Suite products which caught my attention. Leave a comment below on what you&#39;re looking forward to in this next release!&lt;/p&gt;
