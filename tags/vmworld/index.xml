VMware Explore 2022 was set to be a big event for VMware, with the infamous VMworld branding being changed to VMware Explore along with this being the first in person event since 2019, due to COVID-19. Sure enough, there was no shortage of announcements and information available for everyone this year. Last year at VMworld 2021 we had the announcement of Project Ensemble Tech Preview and this year we saw this formalise into VMware Aria Hub.</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2021 vRealize Announcements</title><link>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmworld-2021-vrealize-announcements/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://garyflynn.com/post/vmworld-2021-vrealize-announcements/</guid><description>
VMworld 2021 was still held online only this year, which meant there was no shortage of announcements and information available for anyone interested. With a few large announcements including the Project Ensemble Tech Preview and Skyline Advisor Pro, there is plenty to keep an eye on in this space. Below I've listed a few things for each of the vRealize Suite products which caught my attention. Leave a comment below on what you're looking forward to in this next release!</description></item></channel></rss>
